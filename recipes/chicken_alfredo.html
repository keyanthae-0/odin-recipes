        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Alfredo is a rich and creamy pasta dish that combines tender, seasoned chicken with a velvety Alfredo sauce. The recipe starts by cooking fettuccine pasta until al dente, then pan-searing seasoned chicken breasts to golden perfection. In the same pan, garlic is sautéed in butter, then heavy cream is added and simmered to create a luscious sauce. <br> Grated Parmesan cheese is stirred in, giving the sauce its signature creamy, cheesy texture. The cooked pasta is tossed in the sauce, ensuring every strand is coated, and the sliced chicken is added on top for a hearty, satisfying dish.
           This comforting classic is quick to prepare, making it perfect for a weeknight dinner or special occasion. <br>With its blend of flavors—rich cream, sharp Parmesan, and savory chicken—Chicken Alfredo is always a crowd-pleaser. Garnished with a sprinkle of fresh parsley for color, it’s the ultimate indulgence for anyone craving creamy, cheesy goodness.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>8 oz fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil (for cooking the chicken)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (preferably freshly grated)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chopped parsley (for garnish, optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pasta:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to the package instructions, usually about 8–10 minutes, until al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving about 1/2 cup of pasta water for later. Set aside.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cook the chicken:
                <ul>
                    <li>While the pasta is cooking, season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or pan over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken breasts and cook for about 6–7 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature should reach 165°F / 74°C).</li>
                    <li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. Let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it into strips or bite-sized pieces.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Makes the Alfredo Sauce:
                <ul>
                    <li>In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for 1–2 minutes until fragrant, being careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
                    <li>Slowly pour in the heavy cream while stirring, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for about 3–5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add the Cheese:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce the heat to low, and gradually add the grated Parmesan cheese, stirring continuously until it’s fully melted and the sauce becomes smooth and creamy.</li>
                    <li>Taste the sauce and season with more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Combine Pasta and Sauce:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the drained fettuccine pasta into the skillet with the Alfredo sauce, tossing gently to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water, a little at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Serve:
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide the creamy chicken Alfredo pasta onto plates. Top with sliced chicken and a sprinkle of chopped parsley (if using).</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately, and enjoy!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
