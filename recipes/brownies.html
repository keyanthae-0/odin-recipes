        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Brownies are one of those timeless desserts that feel like comfort in every bite. They’re dense, chocolaty squares with a soft center that melts just slightly under the warmth of your fingers. <br>The aroma alone—deep cocoa mixed with a hint of butter—can turn an ordinary day into something a little sweeter. Each bite gives that perfect blend of chewiness around the edges and velvety softness in the middle, <br>with a rich flavor that satisfies any chocolate craving.
