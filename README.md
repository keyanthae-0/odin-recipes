# odin-recipes
This is my first real project. Although it's nothing flashy with it being pure HTML, Completing this felt good.
My project consists of Chicken Alfredo, Brownies, and Tres Leche Cake.
I have learned alot more even though I already had knowledge in HTML. I now Know the basic boilerplate instead of just using the shortcut "!".
